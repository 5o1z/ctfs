PM2000 is a mission-critical, enterprise-grade solution empowering
stakeholders to seamlessly manage and execute standardized operational
protocols - or "synergistic action matrices" - across the entire
digital ecosystem.

The system's core value proposition lies in its ability to transform
reactive firefighting into a proactive, metrics-driven discipline.
By codifying institutional knowledge into repeatable "success
blueprints," PM2000 minimizes human error, accelerates time-to-resolution,
and ultimately optimizes resource allocation.

Traditionally, playbooks are just lists of steps:

Daily routine.
1. Check time
  a. `date`
  b. Double check
  c. `sleep 1`
  d. `date`
2. List files
  a. `ls`

PM2000 introduces Standardized Operational Procedure Syntax (SOPS).
SOPS leverages a highly formalized, yet remarkably intuitive, "protocol
specification grammar," enabling stakeholders to define sequential
execution pathways with unparalleled clarity. Each "actionable directive"
within a SOPS playbook is expressed through a standardized nomenclature,
ensuring unambiguous interpretation and seamless execution by the underlying
PM2000 engine. The legacy playbook would be translated into SOPS as follows:

note: Daily routine
STEP
  note: Check time
  STEP
    cmd: date
  ENDSTEP
  STEP
    note: Double check
  ENDSTEP
  STEP
    cmd: sleep 1
  ENDSTEP
  STEP
    cmd: date
  ENDSTEP
ENDSTEP
STEP
  note: List files
  STEP
    cmd: id
  ENDSTEP
ENDSTEP
